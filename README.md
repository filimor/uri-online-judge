## Description

This repository is built as problems are solved on the website
[URI Online Judge Problems and Contests](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) that has over 2100 problems and 9 main
categories. It supports many languages (including C, C++, C#, Dart, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Lua, Pascal,
PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala) and is very useful to practicing and learning programming logic and algorithms. The website
is available in english, portuguese and spanish. Although the repository name and readme follow the open source language
convention (english), the problems names, descriptions, variables names and strings are all in portuguese.
Unfortunately, the rest of the repository pages remains without translation.
